Add mPDF engine compatibility to PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce for flexible document creation.

== Description ==

Enhance your PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce with mPDF engine integration, replacing the default engine for improved handling of specific languages, including Arabic and Hebrew. This alternative offers robust support for right-to-left orientation, ensuring seamless document creation for a wider range of linguistic needs.

If you require support for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (CJK) fonts, please install the separate CJK extension available at [GitHub](https://github.com/wpovernight/woocommerce-pdf-ips-mpdf-cjk). This extension ensures compatibility with these languages and needs to be installed separately as it is no longer bundled with this plugin.
